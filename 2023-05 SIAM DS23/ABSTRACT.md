# Three-dimensional horseshoes and orientation reversal in wild chaos
 
Wild chaos is a new type of dynamics with certain robustness properties that can arise in diffeomorphisms of dimension at least three. An important ingredient in this context is a blender: a hyperbolic set with invariant manifolds that appear to be higher-dimensional than expected. The existence of a blender may imply  the robust presence of complicated global connections between different parts of phase space.

What does a blender actually look like and how does it appear or disappear? We consider a HÃ©non-like family of maps that exhibits a blender generated by a three-dimensional horseshoe. We investigate how the orientation properties of the map affect the structure of the blender by employing advanced numerical techniques to compute the stable or unstable manifolds of the hyperbolic set in a compactified phase space. This allows us to characterise geometric differences, which are important for how blenders lose their defining properties as parameters change.
