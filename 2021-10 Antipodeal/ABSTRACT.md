# BLENDERS IN A 3D HENON-LIKE MAP 

Wild chaos is a new type of chaotic dynamics that can only arise in systems of sufficiently high dimension. To construct an abstract example of higher-dimensional dynamical systems that exhibit wild chaos, Bonatti and Díaz introduced the notion of a blender in 1996 [1]. The characterising feature of blenders is that they admit invariant manifolds that behave as geometric objects of higher dimensions than expected from the dimensions of the manifolds themselves. This may imply the existence of complicated and robust heterodimensional connections between different parts of phase space, which can lead to wild chaos.

The first explicit example and image of a blender was introduced by S. Hittmeyer et al. in 2018 [2]. Based on that example, we construct a three-dimensional Hénon-like map that also exhibits a blender and has the ingredients to expect existence of heterodimensional connections. With advanced numerical techniques, we compute stable and unstable manifolds of this map and investigate changes in their geometric properties that bring about the generation or disappearance of blenders and associated wild chaotic dynamics.
