# Exploring wild chaos in a 3D Hénon-like map
** Awarded: Red Sock Award

Wild chaos is a new type of chaotic dynamics that can only arise in systems of sufficiently high dimension. Wild chaotic dynamics can be generated with a geometric tool called a blender. Blenders admit invariant manifolds that behave as geometric objects of higher dimensions than expected from the dimensions of the manifolds themselves. This may imply the existence of complicated and robust heterodimensional connections between different parts of phase space, which can lead to wild chaos.

We construct a three-dimensional Hénon-like map that exhibits a blender and has the ingredients to expect existence of heterodimensional connections. With advanced numerical techniques, we compute stable and unstable manifolds of this map and investigate changes in their geometric properties that bring about the generation or disappearance of blenders and associated wild chaotic dynamics.
