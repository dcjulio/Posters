# Blenders hunting: the search for wild chaos
** Awarded: Judges' Choice Second Place

Wild chaos is a new type of dynamics with specific robustness properties. An essential ingredient in this context is a blender: a geometric object that appears to be higher-dimensional. What does a blender look like? We investigate the structure of the blender to characterise its geometry as parameters change.
